"""NovaRouter's terminal — one path, hostable on its own.

Every terminal behaviour lives under this package, and nothing in the project
reaches around it: the gateway, the agent and the dashboard all import from
`terminal.*` (see `routers/admin_terminal.py`, `main.py`, `nova/agent.py`).
That is what makes the terminal separable — the whole feature is this
directory, so it can be deployed on its own machine while the rest of the app
stays connected to it.

    terminal/pty.py      real PTY session manager (the shells behind the tabs)
    terminal/sandbox.py  simulated allowlist executor for one-shot commands
    terminal/link.py     LocalLink (in-process) / RemoteLink (separately hosted)
    terminal/api.py      the HTTP contract, mounted by BOTH hosts
    terminal/service.py  the standalone host: `python3 -m terminal.service`
    terminal/config.py   the NOVA_TERMINAL_* knobs that choose the link
    terminal/run.sh      launcher for the standalone host

Dependency direction is one-way: `terminal` may use `nova`'s pure config,
model and telemetry helpers, never the other way round. `__init__` re-exports
the link seam only — it deliberately does not import `api` (FastAPI) or
`sandbox` (SQLAlchemy), so importing the seam stays cheap on both hosts.
